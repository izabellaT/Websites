About the projects in this repository:

The "MovieWebAppStaj" project, developed two years ago, was my first significant project to feature improvements in HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap. It was also my first project to implement an authentication and authorization system, marking a major step forward in functionality. This project was built using Visual Studio 2019 and .NET 5.0, serving as a foundation for more complex future projects.

The next key project, "Skating", was developed entirely in Visual Studio Code. It helped me refine my knowledge of front-end web development by incorporating more advanced features and techniques in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project served as inspiration for my largest project to date — "SkateAppWeb".

"SkateAppWeb", my diploma project, represents the culmination of everything I've learned in both front-end and back-end web development. It is a full-fledged online store for skateboarding goods and accessories, created using Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.0. This project is a perfect blend of functionality and design, reflecting my ability to manage both the aesthetic and technical aspects of web development.

Some standout functionalities of SkateAppWeb include:

Two product configurators: One for general customers and another for administrators, providing dynamic customization options.
Comprehensive CRUD operations: Users can create, read, update, and delete products, reviews, brands, favorites, and more. This includes an intuitive admin interface for managing the pre-seeded data (categories, brands, etc.).

User management and role assignment: The platform supports three distinct user roles—customer, seller, and administrator—each with different permissions for managing products, orders, and users.

Review and favorite system: Customers can create, edit, and delete reviews, as well as add products to their favorites list.

Promo code integration: Shoppers can apply promo codes during checkout, enhancing the shopping experience with dynamic pricing.

Currency switching: Users can switch between BGN and EUR currencies, catering to international customers.

Sorting and filtering options: Customers can filter and sort products based on various criteria for easier browsing.

Pre-seeded data management: Brands and categories are pre-seeded into the database but can be added, removed, and edited dynamically.

Other features: Includes a "back to top" button for improved navigation and an elegant, responsive design that ensures a seamless experience across all devices.

This project also draws inspiration from my earlier WebShopApp project, which focused on backend architecture improvements such as managing registered users, handling roles, data seeding, and providing core e-commerce functionalities. However, SkateAppWeb goes further by merging all of these backend functionalities with a well-designed, modern user interface that offers a great user experience.

SkateAppWeb exemplifies my full range of skills and is a complete e-commerce solution that meets all the requirements I set for it, making it my most ambitious and accomplished project to date.
